# YT_Streamer
```diff
+ This is a simple script that can stream audio from youtube based on search results you give.
@@ EDIT: You can now install this via pip @@
Requires gstreamer and python3-gst-1.0
```
Works on linux.
You might be able to get it working on macos.

This depends on gstreamer so you're out of luck if you use windows.

**This code was written a long time ago and is definitely not something you should take inspiration from. That being said, it still works lol.**


```pip3 install ytstreamer```
